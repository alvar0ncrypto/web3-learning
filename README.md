# Web3 Learning

This repository contains my structured learning path into Web3 development.
It covers core JavaScript, Solidity smart contracts, Ethereum fundamentals,
and full-stack decentralized application (dApp) development.

The goal of this repo is to build a strong foundation in Web3 through
hands-on projects, clean code, and real-world use cases.

Topics include:
- JavaScript fundamentals for Web3
- Ethereum & blockchain basics
- Solidity smart contracts
- Security-aware development
- dApp architecture
